# dbtestgen

CLI to copy partially relational models from a SQL database to generate test databases.

## The Problem

> Some time ago I try to find a way to automate the test of part of the old application, that by chance is the main application in the company, and do not have any kind of documentation to use the parameter to replicate the database, all is made in production. So I found some tools, but none work well, and I started studying [Go](https://golang.org)

## TODO

- [ ] Pass configuration to the CLI;
- [ ] Execute DDL on output DBs;
- [ ] Extract data from table too;
- [ ] _Where_ parameter to filter data from tables;
- [ ] Tests;
- [ ] Get better the API;
- [ ] SemVer;
